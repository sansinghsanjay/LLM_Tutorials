Four friends decided to go on a trekking. Since they were enjoying their vacation which was about to over in the next 10 days, thus they had only 10 days for their trekking. Consequently, they planned to leave for trekking on the same day. Since their train to the trekking destination was in a hour, thus they quickly rushed to a supermarket which was beside a restaurant.
Because of their fash driving, a tall man walking in fron of the restaurant got afraid and jumped in the opposite direction to save himself but his head hit a metallic street light pole and he lost his life right there.
All the four friends are now apprehended by the police for fast driving.
