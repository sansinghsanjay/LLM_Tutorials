A tall person with a height of 7 feet 2 inch was walking outise the restaurant and he saw that a fast running car is about to hit another car standing beside him. So, without delaying even for a second, he jumped to the opposite direction, i.e., east; but he could not survive as his head collided with an electric pole.
Immediately police reached the location and arrested the car driver.
